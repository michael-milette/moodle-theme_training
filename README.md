# FAQ

## Frequently Asked Questions

IMPORANT: Although we expect everything to work, this ALPHA release has not been fully tested in every situation. If you find a problem, please help by reporting it in the [Bug Tracker](http://github.com/michael-milette/moodle-theme_training/issues).

### Why does my course grid view look un-even?

The optimal size for course summary images when using this theme is 540 px wide by 300 px high. With that said, there really isn't any restriction on how tall you should make an image. However, for best results, be consistent in the height and width.

### Are there any security considerations?

There are no known security considerations at this time.
